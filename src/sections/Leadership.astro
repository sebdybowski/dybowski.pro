    <h2>Leadership</h2>
    <p>
      As a team lead and agile coach, I'm all about empowering my team to deliver amazing results. I lead by example, fostering an environment of collaboration, trust, and transparency. Whether we're using Scrum, Kanban, or another agile framework, I make sure everyone is aligned, motivated, and working towards a common goal. I help my team identify areas for improvement, and I'm always looking for ways to optimize our processes and increase efficiency.
