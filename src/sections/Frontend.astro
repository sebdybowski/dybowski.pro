    <h2>Frontend</h2>
    <p>
      As a front-end wizard, I create digital experiences that are so smooth, you'll swear your screen is gliding on butter. With my mad skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I can bring any design to life and make it responsive to all devices. My weapon of choice is React, but I'm also fluent in other front-end frameworks and libraries. From designing sleek and stylish interfaces to building complex web applications, I'm always up for a coding adventure. Let's make your website look so good, it'll make the internet jealous!
