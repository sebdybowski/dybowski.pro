    <h2>Backend</h2>
    <p>
      I use Node.js to create powerful and scalable server-side applications. Though my Java skills are still in development, I'm always expanding my expertise. I also have experience with AWS, enabling me to design and deploy cloud-based solutions that are both reliable and cost-effective. From REST APIs to complex data processing, I build secure and efficient systems that power digital products to success.
